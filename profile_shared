# -------- Monte's notes: -----------
# ~/.profile is only run for login shells (when the terminal first starts up)
# when bash is the default shell. So it doesn't get called by zsh, or if switching
# from zsh to bash. Standard practice is to use ~/.profile to set environment
# variables and call ~/.bashrc. If we call ~/.profile from ~/.zshrc that works fine,
# but I prefer to leave that file with Ubuntu defaults and create ~/.profile_shared
# that is called by both ~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc. Uncomment the following line to 
# check when this is being run:
#
# echo "Running ~/.profile_shared..."

# Update path to include non-standard location of executables:
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.3/bin:$PATH

# Aliases I want in both bash and zsh:
# -a: hidden files, 
# -A, hidden files but ignore . and ..
# -l, show in a vertical list with extra info
# -F, add / to end of folder names (I appreciate)
# -C, order by columns instead of rows (eh boring)
# -h, show file sizes in kb, gb, instead of just bytes (maybe good? I actually like it the original way)
alias ll='ls -laF' # Show it all
alias l='ls -lF'    # Show the basics in a short list
alias lsa='ls -AF'   # Show it all, but in condensed ls format

alias gitpass='git config --global credential.helper store && echo "Ready to save git credentials."'

# Show Slurm jobs on a cluster. Number indicates spaces for the column info. "." is for right justified.
# u: USER 
# i: JOBID 
# P: PARTITION 
# q: QOS
# a: Account
# Q: Priority
# T: STATE
# R: NODE (or reason pending)
# j: JOBNAME
# M: TIME
# l: TIME Requested 
# C: CPUs Requested
# m: MEM Requested
# b: GPUS Requested
# --me: just my jobs
